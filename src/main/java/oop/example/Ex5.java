        //Simple Math
        /*You’ll often write programs that deal with numbers. And depending on the programming
        language you use, you’ll have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.
        Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the sum, difference, product, and
        quotient of those numbers as shown in the example output:
        Example Output
            What is the first number? 10
            What is the second number? 5
            10 + 5 = 15
            10 - 5 = 5
            10 * 5 = 50
            10 / 5 = 2
        Constraints
            Values coming from users will be strings. Ensure that you convert these values to numbers
            before doing the math.
            Keep the inputs and outputs separate from the numerical conversions and other processing.
            Generate a single output statement with line breaks in the appropriate spots.*/

        int first = Integer.parseInt(firstNumber);
        int second = Integer.parseInt(secondNumber);

        int add = first + second;
        int sub = first - second;
        int mult = first * second;
        int div = first / second;

        System.out.print(firstNumber + " + " + secondNumber + " = " + add + "\n" +
                firstNumber + " - " + secondNumber + " = " + sub + "\n" +
